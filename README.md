Readme.txt to the first VR Project with udacity


Base =======================

Downloaded the P1 Udacity Project, and modified it. 


used software ==============

Unity Personal 64bit (version 5.4.2f2)
Android studio (version 2.2.2) powered by JetBrain


Modifications to the base project ==============

- Added my first and last name to the Hello World Text
- replaced the position and changed the settings of the textfield
- Colored and renamed the 3 last buttons in the box
- changed their functions to "toggle sun and the shape", "change particlecolor", "spawn some random cubes" 


How to use:

This first small project is about the representation of different objects. 
The operation is very simple. Once the app has been installed on the phone, it can be launched through the 
Google Carboard app. If the application is not already set up for the viewer at this point, this should now be done.
After launching the app, please insert the mobile phone into the viewer.


How this app works:
if you enter the app, you are on a grid which represents the bottom of the virtual world. In the background 
you can see the horizon. Furthermore you can see in the foreground a large text of the title of the project 
and my name. If you now move the head with the viewer a little upwards, you can see a red square and the 
unity particle system.
When moving the head down, a menu appears, in which you can do different things in this VR world!


buttons:
Reset: 			Display is again like entering the virtual world
Recenter: 		Resets the display
Toggle sun and shape: 	As soon as you click on this button, you should quickly look at the horizon more 
			closely, as a 2nd change the cube is now a sphere.
Change particle color: 	click on this button to change the colors of the particles
Spawn random cubes: 	here some cubes fall from the top randomly from the sky. 
			If you want to observe the falling cubes, you should see quickly upwards vertically in the sky.

Have much fun playing around in the first little VR Project.

by the way, there is a little easteregg! klick on the sphere or cube in front of you....
