# Udacity-VR-P1-HelloWorld

My First Udacity Project. In this Project you can toggle the sun, 
drop some random cubes from sky, change color of particles.
The Basic Project includes 3 empty Buttons, a headline and a script to use.
This has been modified by me considering the project instructions

## How to use

This first small project is about the representation of different objects. 
The operation is very simple. Once the app has been installed on the phone (load the .apk file on your phone), 
it can be launched through the Google Carboard app. If the application is not already set up for the viewer at this point, this should now be done.
After launching the app, please insert the mobile phone into the viewer.

## How this app works

if you enter the app, you are on a grid which represents the bottom of the virtual world. In the background 
you can see the horizon. Furthermore you can see in the foreground a large text of the title of the project 
and my name. If you now move the head with the viewer a little upwards, you can see a red square and the 
unity particle system.
When moving the head down, a menu appears, in which you can do different things in this VR world!

## Buttons

| button | description | modified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reset | Display is again like entering the virtual world | - |
| Recenter | Resets the display | - |
| Toggle sun and shape | As soon as you click on this button, you should quickly look at the horizon more closely, as a 2nd change the cube is now a sphere. | x |
| Change particle color | click on this button to change the colors of the particles | x |
| Spawn random cubes | some cubes fall from the top randomly from the sky. If you want to observe the falling cubes, you should see quickly upwards vertically in the sky. | x |
